# Clustering

# Clustering Comparison

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (045011_Clustering_Comparison.ipynb) and a CSV file (CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv) for comparing two clustering methods: K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The notebook provides detailed analysis and comparison of the clustering results obtained from these methods using a dataset of car details from Car Dekho.

# Contents

045011_Clustering_Comparison.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for performing K-Means and GMM clustering on the car dataset, along with detailed analysis and comparison of the clustering results.
CAR DETAILS FROM CAR DEKHO.csv: CSV file containing the car details dataset used for clustering analysis.

# Overview

Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. In this analysis, we explore the application of K-Means and GMM clustering algorithms to categorize cars based on their attributes such as selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, etc. The notebook provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the clustering process, evaluation of clustering quality, and comparison of the two methods.

# Key Features
Implementation of K-Means and GMM clustering algorithms.

Evaluation of clustering quality using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.

Comparison of computational efficiency between K-Means and GMM.

Interpretation of clustering results and insights for managerial implications in the automotive industry.
